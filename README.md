## [Getting started](#getting-started)

---
Running in docker:

1. Create you your first bot on [discord-developer-portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Set up your bot and save your bot token since you are able to see it only one time at creation. If you haven't done that you can still reset the token and get a new one.
3. Enable the `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`  and `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT` for your bot.
4. Open the `.env` file and add your bot token to the environment-variable.
5. Now you are pretty much done and you can start your application. You can do that by starting the docker container `$ docker-compose up`.

Running in code:

1. Create you your first bot on [discord-developer-portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Set up your bot and save your bot token since you are able to see it only one time at creation. If you haven't done that you can still reset the token and get a new one.
3. Enable the `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`  and `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT` for your bot.
4. Define a vm-argument for your bot token `-DBotToken=<your-bot-token>`.
5. Create a folder named /matches in your root directory (Might need rw permissions). Or create it elsewhere and use the vm-argument Linux: `-DSaveMatchesPath=/path/to/your/matches/` Windows: `-DSaveMatchesPath=c:\\path\\to\\your\\matches\\`.
6. Start your code.
